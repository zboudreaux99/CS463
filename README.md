# CS463
## Course Project
This project has a starting script `start.sh`

## Prerequisites
It will work without python-venv installed but that is the preferred method. `start.sh` will create a venv and download the required pip modules, run python tests, and start both the frontend and backend.

The website will be accessible at localhost:8080 once you run the `start.sh` script
